v3.0.0\n\nNEW:\n\n支持 AMapUI 库，可通过 AmapUILoaderService 服务加载使用，部分 UI 组件也封装成了指令，如：ui-awesome-marker\n提供加载插件服务：AmapPluginLoaderService，部分常用插件已封装成了指令，如：amap-tool-bar\n\n\nBREAKING CHANGES:\n\n重写了整体的封装架构，不再使用 Promise 封装，全部使用 Observable\n@Output 事件命名统一调整为: 包含na前缀\n不再提供 Getter 和 Setter 的 Wrapper，建议直接调用 amap 原生对象的方法\n移除 amap 相关的类型定义，引入 @types/amap-js-api\n\n\n\n安装\nnpm install -S ngx-amap\nnpm install -D @types/amap-js-api\n# 地图插件类型定义可按需安装：\nnpm install -D @types/amap-js-api-tool-bar\nnpm install -D @types/amap-js-api-heatmap\nnpm install -D @types/amap-js-api-autocomplete\nnpm install -D @types/amap-js-api-place-search\nnpm install -D @types/amap-js-api-driving\nnpm install -D @types/amap-js-api-transfer\n# ...使用\n\nimport NgxAmapModule\n\nExample:\nimport { NgxAmapModule } from 'ngx-amap';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    ...,\n    NgxAmapModule.forRoot({\n      apiKey: '你申请的key'\n    })\n  ],\n  ...\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\n\n使用 ngx-amap 组件时必须给定高度.\n\n简单示例:\n\nhtml:\n\ncss:\n.demo-map {\nheight: 400px;\n}\n\n\n\n\n可以配合使用其他指令和组件。例如 amap-marker 可以在地图中画覆盖物：点标记。\n\n简单示例:\n\nhtml:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n加入地图控件的方法也很简单，例如：amap-tool-bar\n\n简单示例:\n\nhtml:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n由于采用了懒加载高德 JS 库，所以如果需要直接使用全局 AMap 对象的方法，需要等加载完成后使用。\n\n可以在组件  (naReady) 事件之后使用 AMap\n\n也可以使用 AMapLoaderService 的 load 方法\nimport { AMapLoaderService } from  'ngx-amap';\n\n@Component({\n...\n})\nexport class MyComponent implements OnInit {\nconstructor(private loader: AMapLoaderService) {}\n\nngOnInit() {\n  this.loader.load().subscribe(() => {\n    // 高德 JS SDK 加载完毕\n    const dis = AMap.GeometryUtil.distance([123, 456], [123, 456]);\n    console.log(dis: ${dis});\n  })\n}\n}\n\n\n\n更多用法和事件，请参看演示和文档。\n配置\n我们可以通过NgxAmapModule的forRoot()方法设置ngx-amap。它可以接受以下参数传入：\n{\n  apiKey: string;   // 高德地图的开发者license key\n  apiVersion?: string;  // [可选], api 版本, 默认是 '1.4.15'\n  uiVersion?: string;   // [可选], ui 库版本, 默认是 '1.0.11'\n  protocol?: 'http' | 'https'; // [可选], api 路径协议类型\n  debug?: boolean; // [可选], 是否开启调试模式\n  debugTags?: string; // [可选], 开启调试的 TAG, '*' 为全部\n}加载插件\n部分常用插件如: AMap.ToolBar 已封装成指令，可直接使用。\n插件可通过服务：AmapPluginLoaderService 加载后使用。若插件需要 mapObject，可配合 ngx-amap 的 (naReady) 事件一起使用。\n查看示例\n加载UI库\n部分常用 UI 库如: AMapUI.SimpleMarker 已封装成指令，可直接使用。\nUI 库可通过服务：AmapUILoaderService 加载后使用。若 UI 需要使用 mapObject，可配合 ngx-amap 的 (naReady) 事件一起使用。\n查看示例\n指令和服务\n\n\n\nNGX-AMAP\n类型\n高德地图\n类\n演示示例\n\n\n\n\nngx-amap\nComponent\n地图\nAMap.Map\ndemo\n\n\namap-text\nComponent\n覆盖物：文本标记\nAMap.Text\ndemo\n\n\namap-info-window\nComponent\n信息窗体\nAMap.InfoWindow\ndemo\n\n\namap-marker\nDirective\n覆盖物：点标记\nAMap.Marker\ndemo\n\n\namap-polyline\nDirective\n覆盖物：折线\nAMap.Polyline\ndemo\n\n\namap-polygon\nDirective\n覆盖物：多边线\nAMap.Polygon\ndemo\n\n\namap-bezier-curve\nDirective\n覆盖物：贝塞尔曲线\nAMap.BezierCurve\ndemo\n\n\namap-ellipse\nDirective\n覆盖物：椭圆\nAMap.Ellipse\ndemo\n\n\namap-circle\nDirective\n覆盖物：圆\nAMap.Circle\ndemo\n\n\namap-circle-marker\nDirective\n覆盖物：圆点标记\nAMap.CircleMarker\ndemo\n\n\namap-rectangle\nDirective\n覆盖物：矩形\nAMap.Rectangle\ndemo\n\n\namap-tool-bar\nDirective\n工具条插件\nAMap.ToolBar\ndemo\n\n\namap-marker-clusterer\nDirective\n点聚合插件\nAMap.MarkerClusterer\ndemo\n\n\namap-heatmap\nDirective\n图层：热力图\nAMap.Heatmap\ndemo\n\n\nui-simple-marker\nDirective\nUI
